fosroncms
=========
A cms in PHP/Python/Ruby. Different languages, same functionality. 

The code is done for a college course, just to show some basic functionality.
#### Many inconsistencies, not much security, some Lithuanian, some English names. Use it on your own risk!!

All code is done on micro-frameworks.


**PHP version is using:**
* Framework [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/)
* Template system [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/)
* Database access [Doctrine DBAL](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal.html)

**Python version is using:**
* Framework [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)

**Ruby version is using:**
* Framework [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)

_PHP&Python uses SQLite and Ruby uses MySQL (I was keen on deploying it on Ruby. Will change it in future)_

### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

**Better don't install, for now this is just a simple showcase of create/read in PHP/Python/Ruby.**

If you insist on installing it, you must have:
* Silex for PHP (Download an archive/use composer, put it one level down of webroot).
* Flask for Python (pip install flask).
* Sinatra for Ruby (use bundler, the gemfile is there).

_P.S there's no .sql schema for MySQL, sorry for the inconvenience._
